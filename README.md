# Precious_Themes
A series of Emerald themes, based on the vrunner engine. They are based 
off the default theme, and are all visually reminiscent of precious 
stones or precious metals.

## How to use them
You must have Compiz 0.9 as your default WM. (They might work on 0.8, 
but this is untested.) You will need Emerald as your window decorator. 
Double-click on the downloaded files to add them to Emerald Theme 
Manager. Then switch bthemes by clicking on them.
